# MCA monitoring for {{#if profile}}{{ profile }} {{/if}}{{#if stage}}- {{ stage }}{{/if}}

Monitoring setup for MCA generated by the MCA CLI tool

## Available commands

 * `npm run build`   Compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   Watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run synth`   Emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `npm run diff`    Compare deployed stack with current state
 * `npm run deploy`  Deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region

## Troubleshooting

### CloudFormation: "Rate exceeded"

Stacks are being deployed all at once by default.

If some stacks contain too many resources for the deployment to succeed, deployment dependencies can be defined to reduce amount of requests sent to CloudFormation, e.g.:

```js
import * as mca from "mca-monitoring";

const app = mca.createApp();

const stack = mca.setupMonitoringStack(app, "monitoring");
const logGroupMonitoringStacks = stack.addDefaultLogGroupMonitoring();

logGroupMonitoringStacks.forEach(logGroupMonitoringStack => {
  stack.addDefaultLambdaMonitoring().forEach(defaultStack => defaultStack.addDependency(logGroupMonitoringStack));
})
```
